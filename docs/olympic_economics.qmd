## The Economics of the Olympics

When asking the question, "What leads to success at the Olympics?", economic factors may not immediately jump to mind. However, not only is this a big indicative factor to individual countries success, but plays a huge role overall in the game of winning the Olympics. A higher economic output leads to greater potential investment in sports and training facilities for athletes. **Potential** being the key word here, as of course its up to each country how they allocate their resources. In this analysis we are going to take a deep dive into this question of how big of an impact Economic factors play in the grand spectacle that is the Olympics.
