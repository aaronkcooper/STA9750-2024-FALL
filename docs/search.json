In states that allow candidates to appear on multiple party lines, separate vote totals are indicated for each party. Therefore, for analysis that involves candidate totals, it will be necessary to aggregate across all party lines within a district. For analysis that focuses on two-party vote totals, it will be necessary to account for major party candidates who receive votes under multiple party labels. Minnesota party labels are given as they appear on the Minnesota ballots. Future versions of this file will include codes for candidates who are endorsed by major parties, regardless of the party label under which they receive votes.\n\n\n\n\nparty_simplified\n\nDescription: party of the candidate (always entirely uppercase) The entries will be one of: DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, LIBERTARIAN, OTHER\n\n\n\n\nwritein\n\nDescription: vote totals associated with write-in candidates\nCoding:\n\n|:–|:–| | “TRUE” | write-in candidates | | “FALSE” | non-write-in candidates |\n\n\n\ncandidatevotes\n\nDescription: votes received by this candidate for this particular party\nNote: Massachusetts and New York returns often contains entries for “blank,” “other/blank,” “scattering/blank,” and the like. For analyses that depend on an accurate count of votes cast for candidates (rather than turnout, including blank ballots), consult state returns. Future versions of this dataset will distinguish blank ballots from votes cast for scattering candidates.\n\n\n\n\ntotalvotes\n\nDescription: total number of votes cast for this election\n\n\n\n\nversion\n\nDescription: The date the dataset was last updated, in the format yyyymmdd\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\nDescription: The way in which the vote was cast: for example, whether the vote was cast absentee, on election day, or early."

This means that for states where the same candidate might appear on multiple parties, like in NY, they are recorded as such.
